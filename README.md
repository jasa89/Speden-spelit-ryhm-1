# Speden Sepelit

Speden Sepelit is an Arduino-based LED project that simulates various lighting patterns. The project controls a set of 4 LEDs using digital pins 2 to 5 and demonstrates sequential, random, and binary LED lighting effects. This project serves as a fun way to learn how to control LEDs via microcontrollers like Arduino.

## Project Description

The Speden Sepelit project simulates multiple LED lighting effects using an Arduino. It demonstrates various lighting patterns such as:

* Sequential LED blinking
* Random LED selection
* Binary counting representation with LEDs
* Adjustable lighting speed with decreasing delays
* The code is written in C++ for the Arduino platform and uses 4 digital pins (2 to 5) to control LEDs.

## Features

* Sequential LED Blinking: LEDs light up in a predefined sequence.
* Random LED Lighting: LEDs are chosen randomly to light up, adding unpredictability to the pattern.
* Binary Number Display: The LEDs represent numbers from 0 to 15 in binary.
* Adjustable Delay: Lighting speed can decrease over time for dynamic visual effects.

## Hardware Requirements

To recreate this project, you'll need the following hardware components:

* Arduino (Uno, Nano, or any compatible board)
* 4 LEDs (any color)
* 4 Resistors (220Ω or 330Ω recommended)
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires
* USB Cable to connect the Arduino to your computer

## Software Requirements

Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/).
Speden Sepelit Code: Clone or download the project from this repository.
