# Speden Sepelit

Speden Sepelit is an Arduino-based game project that starts when player pushes a button. The project controls a set of 4 LEDs using analog pins 0 to 3  and player must press correct button when led is turned on and it is possible to palyer to follow behind if the order is the same as lighted leds. There is also two sevensegment displays to show countdownt to start the game and to display current score.

## Project Description

The Speden Sepelit projectis a game made using an Arduino. It has several parts as follows:

* Sequential LED blinking
* Random LED selection
* Binary counting representation with LEDs
* Adjustable lighting speed with decreasing delays
* The code is written in C++ for the Arduino platform and uses 4 digital pins (2 to 5) to control LEDs.

## Features

* Sequential LED Blinking: LEDs light up in a predefined sequence.
* Random LED Lighting: LEDs are chosen randomly to light up, adding unpredictability to the pattern.
* Binary Number Display: The LEDs represent numbers from 0 to 15 in binary.
* Adjustable Delay: Lighting speed can decrease over time for dynamic visual effects.

## Hardware Requirements

To recreate this project, you'll need the following hardware components:

* Arduino (Uno, Nano, or any compatible board)
* 4 LEDs (any color)
* 4 Resistors (220Ω or 330Ω recommended)
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires
* USB Cable to connect the Arduino to your computer

## Software Requirements

Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/).
Speden Sepelit Code: Clone or download the project from this repository.
