# Speden Sepelit

Speden Sepelit is an Arduino-based game project that starts when player pushes a button. The project controls a set of 4 LEDs using analog pins 0 to 3  and player must press correct button when led is turned on and it is possible to palyer to follow behind if the order is the same as lighted leds. There is also two sevensegment displays to show countdownt to start the game and to display current score.

## Project Description

The Speden Sepelit projectis a game made using an Arduino. It has several parts as follows:

* Speden spelit.ino to control the game
* buttons files  where buttons are handled
* leds files where leds are handled 
* display files where dispays are handled 
* The code is written in C++ for the Arduino platform.

## Features

* Sequential LED Blinking: LEDs light up in a predefined sequence and the game will speed up after 10 rounds.
* Count down feature on sevensegment displays to show the palyer when the game starts
* 
*
